    <p>The valuation of Elon Musk’s SpaceX hit $180 billion based on an ongoing secondary share sale, CNBC confirmed Wednesday.

        The company is discussing an agreement with investors to sell stock from insiders in a purchase offer at $97 a share, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The offer does not include raising new capital, as the purchase offer represents a secondary sale of existing shares and is expected to close in January.
        
        SpaceX typically performs these secondary rounds about twice a year, to give employees and other company shareholders a chance to sell stock. The latest valuation represents a 20% increase from SpaceX’s previous high of $150 billion, which the company hit through a July secondary sale at $81 a share.
        
        It has a near-monopoly on the U.S. satellite launch market, due to its workhorse Falcon rockets and the struggles of rivals to field operational rockets to compete. SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet business is seen as a key economic driver for the company, with more than 5,000 satellites launched to date and a service boasting upward of two million subscribers. Its monstrous Starship vehicle continues to advance in flight tests, representing an attempt to create a next-generation reusable rocket of unprecedented scale and power.</p>
