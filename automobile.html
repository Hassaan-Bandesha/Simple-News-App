    <p>Toyota Motor’s
        Daihatsu unit will halt shipments of all vehicles both overseas and in Japan, it said on Wednesday, after an investigation into a safety scandal found issues at some 64 models, including 22 sold under the Toyota brand.
       
       An independent panel has been investigating Daihatsu after it said in April it had rigged side-collision safety tests carried out for 88,000 small cars, most of which were sold under the Toyota brand.
       
       The latest revelations suggest that the scope of the scandal is now far greater than previously thought and could potentially tarnish the automakers’ reputation for quality and safety.
       
       Toyota said in a statement “fundamental reform” was needed to revitalize Daihatsu as a company in addition to a review of certification operations.
       
       “This will be an extremely significant task that cannot be accomplished overnight,” it said. “It will require not only a review of management and business operations but also a review of the organization and structure.”</p>
